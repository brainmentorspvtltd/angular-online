ViewEncapsulation modes:

1. Native view encapsulation uses the browser's native shadow DOM implementation to attach a shadow DOM to the component's host element, and then puts the component view inside that shadow DOM. The component's styles are included within the shadow DOM.
component + its children

2. Emulated view encapsulation (the default) emulates the behavior of shadow DOM by preprocessing (and renaming) the CSS code to effectively scope the CSS to the component's view.
global styles will be applied to all the components

3. None means that Angular does no view encapsulation. Angular adds the CSS to the global styles. The scoping rules, isolations, and protections discussed earlier don't apply. This is essentially the same as pasting the component's styles into the HTML.
component + its children + index.html

Styles of this component -> will be applied to the component,its children and also to the main template.
